## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I am not very good working with the flexbox so this helped me practice flexbox and work with it. I also learnt some new CSS properties which can make things much easier.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on the flexbox, grid, and advanced css topics for now and continue to do such projecs.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for understanding some css properties which I am not familiar with. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is also an amazing website which helped me understand some css properties and whenever I am stuck I use this to see where I am going wrong. Both the documentation are very useful and I always use it when I don't understand some property or if I am stuck.
